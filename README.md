## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - HTML Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - This reference helped me structure my HTML documents semantically and build form elements. The main site also includes other references, including but not limited to CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs.

- [W3Schools - CSS Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) - This reference helped answer most of my CSS formatting questions. I really like how the site is organized and how explanations are presented.
